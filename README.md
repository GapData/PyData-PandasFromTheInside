# Pandas from the Inside

Tutorial session from PyData London, Fri 6 May 2016.

This tutorial is designed primarily as a presentation.

If you want to follow along the examples on your own laptop, please

* Download the slides `pfi.pdf`.

* Have the latest versions of Python3, Pandas and IPython installed.
  If you don't have Python already, the easiest route is via the
  full Anaconda Python distribution (300MB). Details are at
  http://conda.pydata.org/docs/installation.html.

* Download a copy of this module `pfi.py`. 

* Download the sample data file http://afltables.com/afl/stats/biglists/bg3.txt. A copy is also included in this repo.
